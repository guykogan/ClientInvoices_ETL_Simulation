"""
Client & Invoice CSV ingestor.

This module provides a simple ingestion utility that scans a directory for CSV files
matching the naming conventions `clients_*.csv` and `invoices_*.csv`, reads them into
pandas DataFrames, and returns two lists of DataFrames.

def ingest(directory_name):
    """
        Ingest CSV files from a directory into DataFrame lists.

        Scans the provided directory for files that:
          - start with 'clients_' and end with '.csv' → appended to `clients_information_list`
          - start with 'invoices_' and end with '.csv' → appended to `clients_invoices`

        Files that cannot be read will be skipped with a warning.

        Parameters
        ----------
        directory_name : str
            Path to the directory containing the CSV files.

        Returns
        -------
        Tuple[List[pd.DataFrame], List[pd.DataFrame]]
            A tuple of (clients_information_list, clients_invoices), where each is a list
            of pandas DataFrames corresponding to the successfully read CSVs.

        Notes
        -----
        - Uses `on_bad_lines='warn'` to continue through malformed rows while logging.
        - This function mutates the global lists defined in this module.
